# Passer-Effectiveness-Rating
Raw code intended to act as a measurement of player performance of 60 premiere league players

//In order to run the code, please open Interface.py in the resources.//

This project is intended to be a learning experience and shell for a future, fully automated measurement.
Given more research into soccer data APIs, the code may be reworked or fully rebuilt in a new repository.
